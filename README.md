Code uses transfer learning and the VGG16 CNN to predict whether an x-ray of lungs have pneumonia or COVID-19. More information on the VGG16 network can be found here:

Code should output confusion tables and accuracy scores (precision, recall, F1-score) for each variation of the CNN that was built.
